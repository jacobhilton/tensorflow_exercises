Python scripts implementing various machine learning algorithms using tensorflow.

- [mnist](mnist) - dense and convolutional feed-forward neural networks, trained and tested on the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset
- [char_rnn](char_rnn) - recurrent neural network for generating text, using a character-level model and a stacked LSTM, as described in [this blog post](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)
